Hello-World repository to learn how to use github.

A little bit about myself. My professional interest is working with customers and partners around the globe to cure their pain points with proudcts (software) and services. I have entrepreneurship spirit. Beside work I enjoy Rock & Roll (guitar), photography and reading. I spent too much time surfing the net searching and learning exciting new technology and politics. 

The process is to go through all aspects of github while:
* creating a repository
* Open and close an issue
* Learn about branches
* Learn about commits
* Learn about pulls (and pull merges)

Well, short and nice...

You should probably do the same with the guide: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
